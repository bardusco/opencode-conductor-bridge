# Product Guidelines: OpenCode Conductor Bridge

## Language
- **English Only:** This is an open source project. All code, documentation, comments, commits, and artifacts must be written in English.

## Prose Style
- **Concise and Direct:** All technical documentation and user-facing text must focus on brevity and clarity.

## Tone and Communication
- **Professional and Actionable:** Communication and error messages should provide clear instructions and status updates without unnecessary fluff.

## Visual Consistency
- **Template-Driven:** Adhere strictly to Conductor's original template formatting for all generated Markdown outputs.

## Implementation Standards
- **Self-Documenting Code:** Prioritize clear naming and structure. 
- **"Why" over "What":** Use comments only to explain non-obvious logic or architectural tradeoffs.

## Metadata and Traceability
- **Explicit Metadata:** Every generated file must include the bridge version and the origin SHA in an HTML comment at the end to ensure auditability and easier debugging.
