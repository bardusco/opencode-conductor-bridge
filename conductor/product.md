# Initial Concept
Bridge Gemini Conductor's Context-Driven Development (CDD) protocol to OpenCode.

# Product Guide: OpenCode Conductor Bridge

## Target Users
- **OpenCode users** who want to use the Conductor methodology.

## Primary Goals
- **Command Mapping:** Map Gemini Conductor's CDD protocol commands to OpenCode context-driven commands.
- **Seamless Installation:** Provide a seamless installation and update mechanism for the Conductor bridge.

## Key Features
- **Command Mapping:** Translating Conductor's `.toml` commands into OpenCode `.md` templates.
- **Automated Synchronization:** Automated synchronization with the upstream Conductor repository.

## Developer Experience
- **Native Feel:** Commands should behave as if they were built directly for OpenCode.
- **Minimal Configuration:** The bridge should work with "out-of-the-box" settings for most projects.

## Project Guidelines
- **Consistency:** Mimic OpenCode's style while honoring Conductor's logic.
- **Maintainability:** Facilitate easy updates when the upstream Conductor project changes.
