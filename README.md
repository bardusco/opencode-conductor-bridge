# OpenCode Conductor Bridge (v1.1.3)

Bridge Gemini Conductor's Context-Driven Development (CDD) protocol to OpenCode.

## Overview

This project allows you to use the [Gemini Conductor](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/conductor) methodology directly in OpenCode. It maps Conductor's commands and templates to OpenCode custom commands while maintaining a reference to the upstream repository.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Git:** Required to clone and update the bridge.
- **Node.js:** Required to run the synchronization and setup scripts.

### 1. Cross-Platform (Recommended)
This method works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
```bash
npx github:bardusco/opencode-conductor-bridge
```

### 2. Standard (macOS/Linux)
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bardusco/opencode-conductor-bridge/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Version Pinning
You can pin a specific version, tag, or SHA by setting the `BRIDGE_REF` environment variable:
```bash
# Windows/Node
$env:BRIDGE_REF="v1.1.3"; npx github:bardusco/opencode-conductor-bridge

# macOS/Linux
BRIDGE_REF=v1.1.3 curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bardusco/opencode-conductor-bridge/main/install.sh | bash
```

### What this does:
1. Clones/Updates the bridge repository to `~/.opencode/conductor-bridge`.
2. Syncs the latest Conductor templates and commands.
3. Links the `/conductor.*` commands to your current project's `.opencode/command` directory.

## Available Commands

Once installed, you can use the following commands in OpenCode:

- `/conductor.setup`: Initialize Conductor in your project.
- `/conductor.newTrack`: Start a new feature or bug fix track.
- `/conductor.implement`: Execute the current track's plan.
- `/conductor.status`: Check the progress of your tracks.
- `/conductor.revert`: Revert a track or task.
- `/conductor.styleguide`: Access language-specific code styleguides (Go, TS, Python, etc.).
- `/conductor.bridge-update`: Update the bridge and its commands to the latest version.
- `/conductor.uninstall`: Remove bridge commands from the current project.

## Threat Model & Security

We focus on transparency and predictability:

1. **Supply Chain:** By default, the installer uses the latest stable tag (e.g., `v1.1.3`). Use `BRIDGE_REF` to pin to a specific SHA for production environments.
2. **Isolation:** The bridge core resides in `~/.opencode/conductor-bridge`. It only exports Markdown-based commands to your projects. No hidden background processes are installed.
3. **Auditability:** Every command generated by the bridge includes metadata linking back to the specific Conductor SHA used to generate it.
