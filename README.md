Bridge Gemini Conductor's Context-Driven Development (CDD) protocol to OpenCode.

## Overview

This project allows you to use the [Gemini Conductor](https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/conductor) methodology directly in OpenCode. It maps Conductor's commands and templates to OpenCode custom commands while maintaining a reference to the upstream repository.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Git:** Required to clone and update the bridge.
- **Node.js >= 18:** Required to run the synchronization and setup scripts.

### Quick Start
Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux:
```bash
npx github:bardusco/opencode-conductor-bridge
```

### Version Pinning
Pin a specific version with `BRIDGE_REF`:
```bash
BRIDGE_REF=v1.1.14 npx github:bardusco/opencode-conductor-bridge
```

## Permissions & Configuration

The bridge installs templates in `~/.opencode/conductor-bridge` and links them to your projects. Since OpenCode accesses files outside your project directory, you might need to adjust your permissions.

If you see permission prompts, configure it in your `opencode.json`:

**Global config** (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`):
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "permission": {
    "external_directory": "ask"
  }
}
```

**Per-project config** (`opencode.json` in project root):
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "permission": {
    "external_directory": "allow"
  }
}
```

Options: `"ask"` (prompt each time), `"allow"` (auto-approve), `"deny"` (block).

See [OpenCode Permissions docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/permissions/) for details.

## Available Commands

Once installed, you can use the following commands in OpenCode:

- `/conductor.setup`: Initialize Conductor in your project.
- `/conductor.newTrack`: Start a new feature or bug fix track.
- `/conductor.implement`: Execute the current track's plan.
- `/conductor.status`: Check the progress of your tracks.
- `/conductor.revert`: Revert a track or task.
- `/conductor.styleguide`: Access language-specific code styleguides (Go, TS, Python, etc.).
- `/conductor.bridge-update`: Update the bridge and its commands to the latest version.
- `/conductor.uninstall`: Remove bridge commands from the current project.

## Threat Model & Security

We focus on transparency and predictability:

1. **Supply Chain:** By default, the installer uses the latest stable tag (e.g., `v1.1.14`). Use `BRIDGE_REF` to pin to a specific SHA for production environments.
2. **Isolation:** The bridge core resides in `~/.opencode/conductor-bridge`. It only exports Markdown-based commands to your projects. No hidden background processes are installed.
3. **Auditability:** Every command generated by the bridge includes metadata linking back to the specific Conductor SHA used to generate it.

### Corporate/Air-Gapped Installation

For environments that block `npx github:`, use manual installation:

```bash
# 1. Clone (or mirror internally)
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bardusco/opencode-conductor-bridge.git
cd opencode-conductor-bridge

# 2. Pin to a specific version
git checkout v1.1.14

# 3. Install dependencies and run
npm ci
node bin/install.js
```

This gives full control over the source and avoids remote execution.
